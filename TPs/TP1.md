# TP01: Experimental Study of Search Algorithms in a Sorted Array

## Objective
The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare several search algorithms applied to sorted arrays. The algorithms studied include:

1. **Simple Sequential Search**
2. **Optimized Sequential Search Utilizing the Order of the Sorted Array**
3. **Iterative Binary Search**
4. **Recursive Binary Search**

## Description
In this project, we will implement the above search algorithms and test them on large sorted arrays that are generated automatically. The search value will also be generated automatically and may not necessarily be present in the array.

### Comparison Criteria
The algorithms will be compared based on the following criteria:

- **Number of Comparisons**: The number of element comparisons made during the search.
- **Average Execution Time**: The average time taken by each algorithm over multiple tests.
- **Average Memory Usage**: The average memory consumption of each algorithm during execution.

For each criterion, we will provide the average value and variance based on more than 30 tests.

## Instructions

1. **Generate Large Sorted Arrays**: Automatically generate sorted arrays of real numbers with sizes of \(10^3\), \(10^4\), \(10^5\), and \(10^6\).
2. **Implement Search Algorithms**: Implement each of the search algorithms listed above.
3. **Measure Comparisons, Execution Time, and Memory Usage**: For each algorithm, measure the number of comparisons, execution time, and average memory usage during the search process.
4. **Conduct Tests**: Perform more than 30 tests for each algorithm and provide a comparative analysis of the results.

## Deliverables
A report containing the following:
- Experimental results
- Comparative graphs showing the number of comparisons, execution time, and average memory usage for each algorithm
- An analysis of the performance of the algorithms
