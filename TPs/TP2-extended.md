# TP2 Extension: Merge Sort Implementation

## Objective
Add merge sort to our sorting algorithms analysis to compare its performance with the basic sorting algorithms (selection, bubble, and insertion sorts).

## Tasks

1. Implement Merge Sort
   - Add merge sort function to `sort_algos.py`
   - Include comparison counter for complexity analysis
   - Handle both random and sorted input arrays

2. Expected Complexity
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)
   - Comparison Complexity: O(n log n)

3. Integration
   - Add merge sort to the benchmark suite
   - Update visualization to include merge sort results
   - Compare performance with other sorting algorithms

## Expected Results
- Better performance than O(nÂ²) algorithms
- Consistent O(n log n) behavior across different input types
- Increased memory usage due to auxiliary space requirement
